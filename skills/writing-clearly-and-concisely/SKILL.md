# Writing Clearly and Concisely

Apply *The Elements of Style* principles to any human-readable prose.

## The 18 Rules

### Grammar & Punctuation (1-7)

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1 | Possessive singular: add **'s** (Charles's, boss's) |
| 2 | Serial comma: A, B, and C |
| 3 | Commas around parenthetical expressions |
| 4 | Comma before conjunction in compound sentences |
| 5 | Don't join independent clauses with comma alone |
| 6 | Don't fragment sentences |
| 7 | Opening participle must refer to subject |

### Composition Principles (8-18)

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 8 | One topic per paragraph |
| 9 | Lead with topic sentence |
| 10 | **Active voice** ("The team fixed" not "was fixed by") |
| 11 | **Positive form** ("dishonest" not "not honest") |
| 12 | **Specific, concrete language** |
| 13 | **Omit needless words** |
| 14 | Vary sentence structure |
| 15 | Parallel form for parallel ideas |
| 16 | **Keep related words together** |
| 17 | Consistent tense in summaries |
| 18 | **Emphatic words at sentence end** |

## Loading Strategy

| Context | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Writing | Apply rules above, consult references/ as needed |
| Editing | Use scripts/copyedit.md with subagent |
| Word choice | Check references/words-commonly-misused.md |

## Quick Patterns

**Vigorous:** Subject → Verb → Object
**Weak:** There is/are, It is, passive voice

**Cut these:**
- "the fact that" → (delete or rephrase)
- "in order to" → "to"
- "the question as to whether" → "whether"
- "owing to the fact that" → "because"
