# Grammar & Punctuation (Rules 1-7)

## Rule 1: Possessive Singular with 's

Add **'s** to form singular possessive, regardless of final consonant.

```
✅ Charles's friend, Burns's poems, the boss's desk
❌ Charles' friend (incorrect for singular)
```

**Exceptions:** Ancient proper names ending in -es or -is: Jesus', Moses', Isis'

## Rule 2: Serial Comma

Use comma after each term in a series, including before the conjunction.

```
✅ red, white, and blue
✅ He opened the letter, read it, and made a note.
❌ red, white and blue (ambiguous)
```

## Rule 3: Parenthetical Expressions

Enclose parenthetical expressions between commas.

```
✅ The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.
✅ Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson, paid us a visit.
```

**Non-restrictive:** Use commas (adds info, could be removed)
**Restrictive:** No commas (essential to meaning)

```
✅ The candidate who best meets these requirements will be hired. (restrictive)
✅ My brother, who lives in Boston, visited last week. (non-restrictive)
```

## Rule 4: Comma Before Conjunction

Place comma before conjunction introducing an independent clause.

```
✅ The situation is perilous, but there is still hope.
✅ I have heard his arguments, but I remain unconvinced.
```

**Short sentences may omit:** "I tried and I failed."

## Rule 5: Don't Join Independent Clauses by Comma

Use semicolon, or make two sentences.

```
❌ It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.
✅ It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.
✅ It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before dark.
```

**If conjunction exists, comma is correct:**
```
✅ It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark.
```

## Rule 6: Don't Break Sentences in Two

Don't use a period where a comma or semicolon belongs.

```
