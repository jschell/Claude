# Composition Principles (Rules 8-18)

## Rule 8: One Topic Per Paragraph

Each paragraph should develop one topic or aspect. Begin new topics in new paragraphs.

**Exception:** Dialogue may have single-sentence paragraphs.

## Rule 9: Topic Sentence First

Begin paragraphs with a sentence that suggests the topic or helps transition.

```
✅ The advantages of this approach are threefold. First...
✅ However, this method has limitations.
```

## Rule 10: Active Voice ⭐

Active voice is direct, vigorous, and concise.

```
❌ The report was written by the team. (passive, 7 words)
✅ The team wrote the report. (active, 5 words)

❌ It was decided that the project should be cancelled.
✅ We decided to cancel the project.

❌ There were many errors found in the code.
✅ The review found many errors in the code.
```

**Pattern:** Subject → Verb → Object

## Rule 11: Positive Form ⭐

Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating language.

```
❌ He was not very often on time.
✅ He usually came late.

❌ She did not think studying was useful.
✅ She thought studying useless.

❌ not honest → ✅ dishonest
❌ not important → ✅ trivial
❌ did not remember → ✅ forgot
❌ did not pay attention → ✅ ignored
```

**Avoid:** not un- constructions ("not unlikely" → "likely")

## Rule 12: Specific, Concrete Language ⭐

Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.

```
❌ A period of unfavorable weather set in.
✅ It rained every day for a week.

❌ He showed satisfaction at the result.
✅ He grinned when he saw the test scores.
```

## Rule 13: Omit Needless Words ⭐

Vigorous writing is concise. Every word should tell.

**Common offenders:**
```
❌ the question as to whether → ✅ whether
❌ there is no doubt but that → ✅ doubtless
❌ in a hasty manner → ✅ hastily
❌ this is a subject which → ✅ this subject
❌ the fact that → ✅ (usually delete entirely)
❌ owing to the fact that → ✅ because
❌ in spite of the fact that → ✅ although
❌ call your attention to the fact that → ✅ remind you
```

**"The fact that" is especially debilitating—eliminate it.**

## Rule 14: Avoid Loose Sentences

Don't string clauses together with "and" and "but." Vary structure.

```
❌ The concert was boring, and the food was bad, and we left early.
✅ Bored by the concert and disappointed by the food, we left early.
```

## Rule 15: Parallel Form

Express coordinate ideas in similar form.

```
❌ Reading is a passion with me. It is not with skiing.
✅ I love reading, but not skiing.

❌ It was both a long ceremony and very tedious.
✅ The ceremony was both long and tedious.

❌ He loved hiking, swimming, and to fish.
✅ He loved hiking, swimming, and fishing.
```

## Rule 16: Keep Related Words Together ⭐

Position words to show relationship clearly. Subject near verb, modifiers near what they modify.

```
❌ He only found two errors. (ambiguous)
✅ He found only two errors.

❌ Cast iron, which we use for cookware, is rarely used for construction.
✅ Cast iron is rarely used for construction, though common in cookware.
```

## Rule 17: Consistent Tense in Summaries

When summarizing a work, use present tense consistently.

```
✅ In the novel, Elizabeth rejects Mr. Darcy's first proposal. She later discovers...
❌ Elizabeth rejected... She later discovers... (inconsistent)
```

## Rule 18: Emphatic Words at End ⭐

The end of a sentence is its most emphatic position.

```
❌ Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has in many other ways.
✅ Since that time, humanity has advanced in many ways, but hardly in fortitude.

❌ This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness.
✅ Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used for making razors.
```

**Pattern:** Build toward the key word or idea.
