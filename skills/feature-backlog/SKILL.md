# Feature Backlog

## Overview

Simple format for tracking features through autonomous work phases.

**Core principle:** One feature in progress at a time.

## Format

```markdown
# Feature Backlog

## In Progress
- [ ] Current feature → plans/feature-name.md

## Todo
- [ ] Next feature
- [ ] Another feature

## Done
- [x] Completed feature (2025-01-29)
```

## Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| One in-progress at a time | Prevents scope creep, context loss |
| Link to plan when planning starts | Connects backlog to execution |
| Mark done only after tests pass | Ensures quality gate |
| Add completion date | Tracks velocity |

## State Transitions

```
Todo → In Progress (when planning starts)
       Link plan file

In Progress → Done (when all tests pass)
              Add completion date
              Archive or delete plan
```

## Alternatives

If using GitHub issues or project boards instead:
- Label `in-progress` for current feature
- Reference plan in issue comments
- Close issue when complete

## Integration

**Used by:**
- **autonomous-work** - Identifies next feature to work on
